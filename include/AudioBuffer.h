/**
 * Allocation and storage for audio buffers.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Can contain planar buffers, an interleaved buffer, or both
 * - Can own its own all its buffers, some of its buffers, or act as
 *       a view for a subset of another AudioBufferData
 * - All buffers have sufficient alignment for SIMD (@see lmms::SimdAlignment)
 * - Can use any memory resource including `SharedMemoryResource`
 * - Supports custom mapping for the planar access buffer, which allows certain routing optimizations
 *       and buffer re-use for in-place processing (see in-depth explanation below).
 *
 * About access buffer mapping:
 * - The access buffer provides fast channel-wise access to channel buffers within the source buffer.
 *   Normally the access buffer maps each index to a buffer using 1-to-1 mapping, so if the source
 *   buffer contains the buffers for 4 channels, accessBuffer()[0] points to the 1st channel buffer,
 *   accessBuffer()[1] points to the 2nd channel buffer, etc.
 * - What this class does is allow alternative mappings that are not necessarily 1-to-1 or in sequential
 *   order.
 *   - For example, accessBuffer()[0] could point to the 2nd buffer while accessBuffer()[1] points
 *     to the 1st buffer. Anyone reading the access buffer would think they're getting left and right
 *     stereo buffers, but they're actually getting right and left buffers - we've swapped the left and
 *     right channels by just swapping two pointers rather than performing expensive buffer copies.
 *   - As another example, accessBuffer()[0] in the input AudioBuffer could point to the same buffer as
 *     accessBuffer()[2] in the output AudioBuffer. Those input and output buffers are the same, which
 *     makes them in-place. This gives it a lot of flexibility for in-place processing.
 *   - As a 3rd example, we could have an immutable silent buffer which is available program-wide, and
 *     we could make a channel silent by simply setting the access buffer pointer of that channel to
 *     the address of the silent buffer. This avoids needing to clear the buffer.
 * - The access buffer mapping can be set with mapAccessBuffer() or reset with resetAccessBuffer().
 * - When using a shared memory resource, access buffers cannot be mapped to any arbitrary buffer - they
 *   can only be mapped to a buffer within the source buffer.
 *
 * Q) Why is there special handling for shared memory resources?
 * - A) Because pointers cannot be stored in shared memory and still be guaranteed to work correctly on
 *      the other end. So instead of storing the access buffer (which is an array of float pointers) in
 *      shared memory, we instead store pointer offsets. However, plugins and other users still expect
 *      a float** access buffer, so it must be allocated separately in non-shared memory. When changing
 *      the access buffer mapping on the server side, both the access buffer and their pointer offsets
 *      in shared memory are updated. But on the client side, refreshSharedMemoryAccessBuffer() must be
 *      called to update the client's access buffer pointers by reading their pointer offsets in shared
 *      memory. This is only required following a change in the access buffer mapping on the server side.
 *
 * Q) Why can AudioBufferData act as a view for a subset of another AudioBufferData?
 * - A) Because the buffers for both the input channels and output channels need to be created in
 *      one contiguous shared memory allocation for use by RemotePlugin, but two AudioBuffers are
 *      needed - one for the inputs and one for the outputs. So if there's one "source" AudioBufferData
 *      which contains the data for all inputs and outputs, it can be split into two non-owning
 *      sections (inputs and outputs) which are stored by an input AudioBuffer and an output AudioBuffer.

/**
 * AudioBuffer is an AudioBufferData with some additional features (and restrictions).
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * - Unlike AudioBufferData which supports up to (2^16)-2 channels (the full ch_cnt_t range minus the
 *       DynamicChannelCount magic number), AudioBuffer is restricted to just MaxChannelsPerAudioBuffer channels.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Silence tracking for each channel (NOTE: requires careful use so that non-silent data is not written to a
 *       channel marked silent without updating that channel's silence flag afterward)
 * - Methods for sanitizing, silencing, and calculating the absolute peak value of channels, and doing so more
 *       efficiently using the data from silence tracking
 * - Can organize channels into arbitrary groups. For example, you could have 6 total channels divided into 2 groups
 *       where the 1st group contains 2 channels (stereo) and the 2nd contains 4 channels (quadraphonic).
 * - Extensive unit testing - @ref AudioBufferTest.cpp
 *
 *
 *
 * An owning or non-owning collection of audio channels for an instrument track, mixer channel, or audio processor.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Up to `MaxChannelsPerAudioBuffer` total channels
 * - Audio data in planar format (plus a temporary interleaved buffer for conversions until we use planar only)
 * - All planar buffers are sourced from the same large buffer for better cache locality
 * - Custom allocator support
 * - Silence tracking for each channel (NOTE: requires careful use so that non-silent data is not written to a
 *       channel marked silent without updating that channel's silence flag afterward)
 * - Methods for sanitizing, silencing, and calculating the absolute peak value of channels, and doing so more
 *       efficiently using the data from silence tracking
 * - Can organize channels into arbitrary groups. For example, you could have 6 total channels divided into 2 groups
 *       where the 1st group contains 2 channels (stereo) and the 2nd contains 4 channels (quadraphonic).
 * - Extensive unit testing - @ref AudioBufferTest.cpp
 *
 * Audio data layout explanation:
 * - All planar audio data for all channels in an AudioBuffer is sourced from the same large contiguous
 *       buffer called the source buffer (m_sourceBuffer).
 * - The source buffer consists of the buffer for 1st channel followed by the buffer for the 2nd channel, and so on
 *       for all channels. In total, the number of elements is `channels * frames`.
 * - A separate vector of non-owning pointers to channel buffers is also maintained. In this vector, each index
 *       corresponds to a channel, providing a mapping from the channel index to a pointer to the start of that
 *       channel's buffer within the source buffer. This is called the access buffer (m_accessBuffer).
 * - The purpose of the access buffer is to provide channel-wise access to buffers within the source buffer, so
 *       it's `m_accessBuffer[channelIdx][frameIdx]` instead of `m_sourceBuffer[channelIdx * frames + frameIdx]`.
 *       This is very important since many APIs dealing with planar audio expect it in this `float**` 2D array form.
 * - Groups have no effect on the audio data layout in the source/access buffers and are merely a layer built on top.
 *       Conveniently, if you take `m_accessBuffer` and offset it by `channelIndex`, you get another `float**`
 *       starting at that channel. This what the `float**` buffer stored in each ChannelGroup is.
 *
 * Naming notes:
 * - When this class is used in an instrument track or mixer channel, its channels could be referred to
 *       as "track channels" or "internal channels", since they are equivalent to the "track channels" used
 *       in other DAWs such as REAPER.
 * - When this class is used in an audio processor or audio plugin, its channels could be referred to
 *       as "processor channels" or "plugin channels".
